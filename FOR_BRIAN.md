Hi Brian,

I thought it might be good to keep these questions in mind while you look at the code. 

- Where would it be wise to have the user_key stored? Its the key I use for most database searches 
and Googling it says that you can't pass variables into the argument-function from a decorator.


- How would you go about refactoring the code? Is creating a package realistic at this stage? I saw a
Youtube tutorial with Corey Schaffer and the code looked so much neater after that.


- Any good "best practises" of handling past period's data?
