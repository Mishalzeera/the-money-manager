# Welcome to Munificent, The Money Manager

Live site is [here](https://mishals-money-manager.herokuapp.com/).

## From the manual:

This app was created to help you make good choices and have peace of mind. In
truth, life is short, money isn't everything and time is precious. Our world
will probably remain a capricious place, with all kinds of financial dangers
lurking around every corner. Taxes, high cost of living and unfairly high
overheads dog us day in and day out.

For many of us, real financial trouble is only one or two bad choices away.

Munificent is designed to give you a quick, handy overview of your money
situation. In practise, it will take income amounts in, and depending on which
option you choose, calculate taxes to set aside for you. Munificent will take
in your expenses, divided into two categories - "overheads" and "extras" - and
keep track of how much of your overheads are paid. You will always have a
handy figure of your disposable income - and your total credit as well.

You won't have to guess.

## Why a financial management app? Why this one?

Most money apps are geared towards achieving specific transactional behaviours.
Not this one. Munificent gives a person without good financial instincts a
way to keep a grip on the big picture. Its an app designed to bridge the gap
between an ordinary person and the kind of financial thinking that keeps them
safer from difficulties.

## Is it difficult to use and understand?

No. However, to get the most out of it, some thought must go into the initial
setup. If you are the sort of person who misses important financial deadlines and
regularily finds themselves struggling to understand their finances, ask a trusted
friend to help you calculate your monthly overheads.

## On The technology used

Munificent uses a MongoDB database and a lightweight Flask backend. Authentication
is handled by Werkzueg tools, password salting etc. Finishing touches are handled
by GSAP animation library.
