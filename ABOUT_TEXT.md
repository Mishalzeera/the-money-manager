Welcome to MM, an app to help you keep track of your finances. 

This app was created to help you make good choices and have peace of mind. In truth, life is short, money isn't everything and time is precious. Our world will probably remain a capricious place, with all kinds of financial dangers lurking around every corner. Taxes, high cost of living and unfairly high overheads dog us day in and day out. For many of us, real financial trouble is only one or two bad choices away.

MM is designed to give you a quick, handy overview of your money situation. In practise, MM will take income amounts in, and depending on which option you choose, calculate taxes to set aside for you. You will then always have a handy figure so that your quarterly taxes are never a shock. MM will take in your expenses, divided into two categories - "overheads" and "extras" - and keeps track of how much of your overheads are paid. 

You don't have to fuss with any pre or post tax figures, just enter the total including tax. MM will take care of the rest for you. 

When setting up your account, it is a good idea to take some time working out what your overheads are. Include things like subscriptions, insurance and of course rent. When you enter your overheads, other factors like your disposable income can be calculated. This allows you to enjoy dinner with a friend without worrying if indeed you should be doing that. 

MM would like to take that kind of uncertainty out of your life, as much as possible.

MM recommends you to set aside 20% of your income a month, and will calculate this suggested amount after taxes have been taken into account. You can choose when to end the current tax period, so that the app resets when it is convenient for you. 

You will notice you have a wishlist you can add stuff to. This can be for luxury items like special clothing or a new car, but it can also be investments into your business, like a new computer or a seminar you would like to attend. The app will mark which of your items are affordable and which are not, so you don't have to guess.

The "reward" page is to remind you of a greater life goal that you would like to work towards. During the more challenging parts of your financial cycle, the image you upload will remind you that down cycles are temporary. You will pull through. There is a bigger picture and you shouldn't forget what it is that really matters to you. If living a carefree life in the Azures is what you want, then put an image of that up. Dont get seduced or frightened along the way into settling for less. 

Of course this is really personal, and we recommend that you spend some time thinking about this carefully. 

Thank you and we wish you every success.
