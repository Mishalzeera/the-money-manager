<h2 class="underline">Welcome to Munificent, The Money Manager</h2>
<p><em>An app to help you keep track of your finances</em></p>
<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This app was created to help you make good choices and have peace of mind. In truth, life is short, money isn't everything and time is precious. Our world will probably remain a capricious place, with all kinds of financial dangers lurking around every corner. Taxes, high cost of living and unfairly high overheads dog us day in and day out. </p>
<br>
<p>For many of us, real financial trouble is only one or two bad choices away.
</p>
<br>


<p>Munificent is designed to give you a quick, handy overview of your money situation. In practise, it will take income amounts in, and depending on which option you choose, calculate taxes to set aside for you. Munificent will take in your expenses, divided into two categories - "overheads" and "extras" - and keep track of how much of your overheads are paid. You will always have a handy figure of your disposable income - and your total credit as well. 
</p>
<br>
<p>You won't have to guess.</p>
<br>
<h3>Setting Up Your Account</h3>
<p>When setting up your account, it is a good idea to take some time working out what your overheads are. Include things like subscriptions, insurance and of course rent. When you enter your overheads, other factors like your disposable income can be calculated. </p>
<br>
<p>This allows you to enjoy dinner with a friend without worrying if indeed you should be doing that. </p>
<br>
<h3>Suggested Savings And Tax Periods</h3>
<p>Munificent recommends that you set aside 20% of your income a month, and will calculate this suggested amount after taxes have been taken into account. You can choose when to end the current tax period, so that the app resets when it is convenient for you. </p>
<br>
<h2 class="underline">Main Features</h2>
<h3>Profile Dashboard</h3>
<p>The Profile Dashboard is where you can see all your relevant figures as well
    as controls to add income, add expenses, manage your quarterly taxes etc.
    It is by far the most dense of all the pages. Not to worry, as there is an
    abridged view that gives you a quick overview without having too much
    clutter. Simply click the icon at the top left of the page to switch between
     the abridged view and the profile dashboard. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Lets go through each of the options on the Profile Dashboard in more detail.</p>

<br>
<h3>Create/Edit Note</h3>
<p>It might be handy to keep some notes for yourself about your current 
    affairs. This could be something as simple as "dont forget its Christmas 
    next month and I need to buy presents for everyone", but of course could 
    be anything useful to you for this particular month. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Simply fill in the notepad and click "Create Note". From then on you can
    edit it as you wish.</p>

<h3>Manage Invoices/Income</h3>
<p>In this area of the app, you can enter money coming into your account, and
    let us know if you would like to calculate the tax you need to pay. Simply
    click the "New Invoice" button and add an invoice. You don't have to fill
    in every field, but it is recommended to do so. 
</p>
<br>
<p>If you do tick the "tax" option on an invoice/income entry, the app will 
    automatically separate the relevant amounts into "income" and "tax to set 
    aside". While the total including tax is added to your "Credit" field, note 
    that "tax to be set aside" is now updated with the tax amount of your 
    most recent entry. "Disposable income" will be updated with the remainder.
</p>
<br>
<p>On the Income page, you will see all your previous entries, along with
    options to modify or delete them.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Manage Expenses</h3>
<p>In much the same way, the Expenses area allows you to keep track of outgoing
    payments. Here, after clicking to "Add Outgoing Expense", you come to a 
    form which allows you to enter as much information as you feel is 
    necessary for you particular style of doing things. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Of particular importance, however, is the "Overheads" vs "Extras" selector.
    This allows the app to calculate how many of your monthly overheads you 
    have paid off, which affects your "disposable income" and "overheads to be
    paid" fields. 
</p>
<br>

<p>Please note that the dates on the left panel of the history reflect the 
    date of the action, not the specific invoices etc. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>End Your Tax Period</h3>
<p>We included a handy tax calculator for when you are going through reciepts.
    This is handy for when you have a lot of reciepts that don't include their
    tax calculations for you. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Simply enter your totals into the field, click "Calculate Tax" and you will
    see the figures for both the tax amount and the post tax total. 
</p>
<br>
<p>To reset your current "tax to set aside" fields and create a record of your
    season, select the checkbox "...if you are sure you want to end your tax
    period.". Then click "End Your Tax Period".
</p>
<br>
<h3>User History</h3>
<p>This page allows you to see all the ins and outs of your finances, as well
    as previous months and tax seasons. On the left is a log of all your
    actions on the app. This includes modifying and deleting both expenses 
    and incomes. On the right, you have an overview of your previous months
    finances. Beneath that, an overview of your tax seasons. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Wishlist</h3>
<p>In this page, you can add all the things that you would like to buy or 
    invest in. This can be anything from new clothing or kitchenware to 
    an exciting course you would like to take and invest in yourself. The 
    app will automatically let you know if it is realistically affordable
    by using your "disposable income" field as a reference point.

</p>

<br>
<h3>Reward</h3>
<p>In this page you can remind yourself of a "big picture" life goal you have,
    so that you don't lose focus. During the more challenging parts of your financial cycle, the image you upload will remind you that down cycles are temporary. You will pull through. There is a bigger picture and you shouldn't forget what it is that really matters to you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If living a carefree life in the Azures is what you want, then put an image of that up. Dont get seduced or frightened along the way into settling for less. 
</p>
<br>
<p>You are allowed only one, so choose something that makes you feel good
    every time you see it.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>In this important page, you can manage all the key settings of your Money 
    Manager. If you have trouble finding it, its the "cogs" symbol next to the "Logout" button.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>The first field is regarding your monthly overheads. Once you 
    have paid a debt off, or cancelled a subscription, you can come here and
    re-enter the figure you calculate for your monthly expenditures. You will 
    see an indication of the current amount in the field box
</p>
<br>
<p>The second field is your tax rate settings. Here you can adjust the 
    percentage used to calculate your taxes. You will also see the current
    amount indicated in the field box.
</p>
<br>
<p>A light vs dark theme toggle switch is there, for those who are particular
    about such things.
</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, the option to delete your account. Please note that all your 
    information will be erased, including your wishlist and reward images as 
    well.
</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you and we wish you every success. </p>
